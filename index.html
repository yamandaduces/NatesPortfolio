          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            First off, welcome! This is my first official website! Now let's get
            you to know me a little, I am a fresh highschool graduate that is
            hoping to get into Durham Technical Community College. I love music,
            art, spending time with those I value, long boarding, playing video
            games, seeing the sights, and solving a daily calander puzzel. I
            work hard and to the best of my ability, I work well under pressure
            and improvise well. While I am lacking in work experience I am
            certainly not lacking in knowledge, I did graduate highschool with
            my honors and with an advanced diploma. I am not one to usually
            start socializing but if I have to I can and become friends with
            those I do socialize with. I would describe myself As a friendly
            figure, kind, smart, dedicated, hard working, and unbreakable. As
            time goes on I hope to gain more experience, graduate from college
            and be able to live comfortably.
